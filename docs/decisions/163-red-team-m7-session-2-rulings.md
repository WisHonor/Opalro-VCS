# 163 — Red team on milestone 7, second session: six findings, all fixed

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-11-14
- **Agenda topic:** none (milestone 7, its second red-team session, RT18)
- **Decided by:** Claude, at the owner's request while the owner was away. The owner can reverse any part.
- **Refines:** [decision 162](162-red-team-m7-rulings.md) (the refusal's hints; what `line delete` names; how an odd tag name is shown; what a hint may carry); [decision 055](055-lines-in-v0.1.md) (where a save is looked for by the start of its fingerprint)

## Context

The second session on milestone 7 (RT18, [report](../redteam/2026-11-14-milestone-7-session-2.md)) attacked the fixes of the first ([decision 162](162-red-team-m7-rulings.md)) and what the first had left undone, on a copy of `milestone-7` at d149d80 in the no-network sandbox. It found six things: one medium, five low. None loses data, skips a question, or takes a name for the wrong save. The fixes hold where they were aimed. What broke was the advice around them: Opalro told a person to type something it then refused.

What held: all four commands read a name through one place; the refusal can't be dodged and fails closed when the tag list can't be read; `line delete` writes nothing before it stops; odd names never ended a question early or made a second row. Two commands at once, tidying after a deleted line, and a planted diary step were checked by reading the code, and held.

- **RT18-1 (Medium).** The refusal of decision 162 shows each save's ID and says to type it. But a save was found by its fingerprint only when a line reached it. A server line's save is often ahead of every line, and an imported tag can sit on a save no line reaches. For those the ID shown was refused, and for a server line nothing at all reached its save while the tag was there.
- **RT18-2 (Low).** `line delete` named a tag whose own save can't be read, but not one whose save is there while an older save behind it is missing: that still gave `object … is not in the store` with no hint.
- **RT18-3 (Low).** A quoted tag name could still hold `]  [main]  [` inside the quotes, so its row in `history` still showed a `[main]`.
- **RT18-4 (Low).** After `opalro show` of a save that isn't on the line the project is on, the next step it suggested (`opalro changes --save <ID>`) used a short ID that only works on the line, and failed. This is older than milestone 7; tags and server lines made it common.
- **RT18-5 (Low).** Following the refusal's advice (go to the line's save by its ID) worked, and then said `To keep saving on v1: opalro goto v1`, which is the refusal again.
- **RT18-6 (Low).** When a shelf can't be brought back, the hint put the shelf's stored label inside a command. Opalro only makes labels that are numbers, but a planted project can hold `1; touch pwned`. This too is older than milestone 7, and it is the same mistake decision 162 fixed for tags.
- **Suspicions, without proof.** Reading a line's name now holds the whole tag list twice: with a tag list just under the largest a record can be (7,900 tags with 64 KiB messages), `goto main` peaked at 1.0 GB in a debug build. A tag list that can't be read now stops `goto` by any name. Wide characters can run a little past the width (known since the first session).

## Options

**The IDs the refusal shows (RT18-1)**

- **A. Make them work:** a fingerprint also finds a save that a server line or a tag reaches. Those saves are held already, by `tidy` and by `line delete`.
- **B. Show only IDs that work, and otherwise name another way out.** For a server line whose save no line reaches there is no ID to show.

**A save the walk can't read, behind a holder's own save (RT18-2)**

- **A. Name the holder whose history holds it,** found by one more look after the walk has failed.
- **B. The plain damage message,** without the holder's name.

**A third session on these fixes**

- **A. None:** the fixes are small, each has its proof test, and the whole-branch review reads them. Milestone 8's session attacks names and hints again, since `combine` prints both.
- **B. A third session now.**

## Decision

**A, A and A; the rest fixed as the report suggests.**

- **RT18-1.** A save is found by the start of its fingerprint among the saves that lines, server lines and tags reach along first parents. (Reaching saves through every parent, as a combine will need, is milestone 8's.) The refusal's hints also name the way to end the double meaning:
  - for a line: `To reach one of them, type its ID as shown here. To end the double meaning, rename the line (opalro line rename <old> <new>) or delete the tag (opalro tag --delete <name>).`
  - for a server line: `To reach one of them, type its ID as shown here. To end the double meaning, delete the tag: opalro tag --delete <name>`
- **RT18-2.** When the walk can't read a save, `line delete` looks for the first line, tag or server line whose history holds it and names it as damage: `the tag ghost names a save whose history can't be read: …`. When only the deleted line's own history holds it: `line feat's history can't be read: …`. Nothing is deleted either way.
- **RT18-3.** Inside the quotes of an odd name, `[` and `]` are written `\[` and `\]`, as `"` and `\` already are, so no line's mark can appear inside it.
- **RT18-4.** A save's ID inside a hint's command is one the command will take from where the project is: its short change ID when the save is on the line, otherwise the first 12 hex digits of its fingerprint.
- **RT18-5.** `goto` says `To keep saving on <line>: opalro goto <line>` only when that command would go onto the line. When the line's name is also a tag at another save it says: `Line v1 is here too, but v1 is also a tag at another save. To keep saving on the line, rename it first: opalro line rename <old> <new>`
- **RT18-6. No hint puts text from the project inside a command unless it is plain:** only the characters a line's name may have, not starting with `-` (and `line@server` when both parts are so). Anything else is left out: the hint then says to run the same command again, or shows a placeholder. This is one rule in one place, for names, labels and paths alike.
- **The tag list is read once for one name,** not twice.
- **No third session.**

## Consequences

- RT18-4 and RT18-6 are in v0.1's draft release too, since both are older than milestone 7. Neither loses data: one is a suggestion that fails, the other needs a planted project and a person who pastes a hint. They are fixed on `v0.2`; whether v0.1 gets them before it is published is the owner's call ([rulings](../plans/2026-11-14-milestone-7-rulings.md), "Please confirm").
- A fingerprint now also reaches a tag's save and a server line's, and the saves behind them along first parents. A line or tag named with 8 or more hex digits is checked against those too (decision 068).
- A tag list near the largest a record can be still costs about half a gigabyte to read for one name. Looking a name up needs only the names; reading the list in pieces is on the [follow-ups](../plans/2026-11-01-milestone-1-follow-ups.md).
- The damage message for a tag list that can't be read doesn't say that `opalro undo` may bring the project back; also on the follow-ups.
- The six proof tests (`crates/opal-vcs/tests/redteam18.rs`) run on every push once each fix is in.
- **Correction, the same day, from the review of the fixes.** A name already read the tag list once before these fixes. The gigabyte the report measured is the stored record and the list decoded from it, held at the same moment. So a tag list near the largest a record can be costs about a gigabyte for one name, not half, and "read once, not twice" above only pins what was already so. The follow-up stands.
- **And one hint reworded by the same review.** When a shelf's label isn't plain, the hint doesn't say to run the same command again: after a plain `opalro unshelf` and a new shelf, that would bring back the wrong shelf. It shows `opalro unshelf <label>` as it stands and says that `opalro shelf --list` shows the label.
